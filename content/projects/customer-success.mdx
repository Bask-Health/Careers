## About Us:


Bask Health is at the forefront of the health-tech industry, providing personalized healthcare experiences through advanced, user-friendly technology. Our platform serves as a launchpad for entrepreneurs, doctors, physicians, and influencers in the DTC telehealth sector.


Bask is the best telehealth platform on the market. Our mission is to empower entrepreneurs and businesses to launch a DTC telemedicine company quickly and easily, abstracting away the complexities of the industry into an easy-to-use platform. With hundreds of features to meet the unique needs of telehealth, we put all the tools in our customers hands for success. We are a rapidly growing startup, and we work with care and intention to create a high-performance company with the following in mind:


•	Speed Wins. Make decisions, move quickly, and know that if things go wrong, it's okay for you and the company. 
•	Intuition, Then Data. We're a data-driven company. We start with our instincts and then use data to validate our decisions and improve
•	Miles, Not Inches. Thinking small is a self-fulfilling prophecy. Favor bold ideas over incremental changes
•	Customer-Obsession. We are obsessed with helping all our customers launch multi-billion-dollar companies with ease. We accomplish this by knowing our customers incredibly well and finding ways to make their businesses better. 
•	 Ownership & Accountability, together. We embody a culture of extreme ownership, accountability, and teamwork. We count on every team member to take responsibility for their work, embrace a proactive mindset to overcome challenges, and work together to achieve our collective success
