## About Us:


Bask Health is at the forefront of the health-tech industry, providing personalized healthcare experiences through advanced, user-friendly technology. Our platform serves as a launchpad for entrepreneurs, doctors, physicians, and influencers in the DTC telehealth sector.


### Job Description:


As a software engineer at Bask you will work directly with the CEO, CTO, and the rest of the team to build and design the software infrastructure that will serve as the backbone of telehealth.


We are looking to expand our software engineers, seeking those with deep rooted entrepreneurial spirit.


Our serverless platform is built using Next.js and AWS for a powerful multi-tenant application.


It is important to be familiar with these frameworks, with JavaScript/TypeScript and API architecture being a must.

### What You'll Do:


- Help design and document new services through the full development cycle: write elegant, well-tested code, documenting code and APIs, in a modern technology stack.
- Help run stand-ups, code reviews, and retros, and help contribute and drive the engineering culture that focuses on simple, intuitive, high-impact experiences.
- Help to create testing across all environments (end user testing to lints)
- Be an engineering generalist: from developing servers and databases, to integrating APIs to expand our platforms capabilities, to final Ul implementation, to you'll have the opportunity to take end-to-end ownership and responsibility across the full development lifecycle.
- Build from 0 to 1: You'll have the opportunity to both scale and automate existing services while also bringing new innovations to life. This is unique opportunity to help join a team where you'll be able to both build rapidly, and also contribute to product strategy and development! We are a highly collaborative team.


### Who We're Looking For:

The ideal candidate is a full-stack generalist, and has experience taking a product from 0-1 product. We're looking for someone who's entrepreneurial and willing to roll up their sleeves to get the work done, and passionate about our mission to build a platform that will intensely disrupt the healthcare industry.

- You lean backend but are dangerous enough on the frontend of the stack.
- You are a highly skilled dev (React, TypeScript, Next.js, JavaScript).
- You also have strong backend skills (Rust, mySQL, Cloud Functions, Microservices Architecture).
- You can work independently and are comfortable owning entire projects and or large areas of the code base
- Strong experience in building paid products and services is preferred.
- You are a strong communicator - you are able to clearly articulate technical problems, constraints and timelines.
- Good at writing technical documentation.
- You are comfortable working in a fast-paced, unstructured, startup environment.
